## Project Overview

This project explores working memory capacity limitations using the pyClarion agent, a cognitive modeling framework. The aim is to simulate and analyze how working memory constraints affect cognitive processes.

## Commit Tag
The latest commit for review is 7d5557f.

## Folder and File Structure
This repository has a simple structure. The project involves two files: no_chunking_demo.py and chunking_demo.py.
These two files will run simulations, print results and plot them when you run each file. Both files are in
one folder COG403. 

## Features

- Implementation of pyClarion agent models.
- Simulation of working memory tasks.
- Analysis of cognitive performance under varying memory constraints.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pyClarion library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cog403.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cog403
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start simulations in No-Chunking and Chunking condition on bash.

```bash
python no_chunking_demo.py
python chunking_demo.py
```
